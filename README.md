# BCOMP-Hackathon

**Project description**
For this project we decided to build a website that allows others to use our templates for their own website. These sites are aimed at technology professionals who, often times, produce these technical resume websites to show future employers their skills and determination. The project is built with a html and css front-end developed website which shows the 9 templates we were able to prepare during the 40 hours of coding. Paired with a PHP back end, when the user clicks on the template they want, they are brought to a html form that gets all the required information for the specific template. The PHP backend then gets the information they provided and inserts it in our templates to make their website instantly. When the user submits the form, they can download the HTML and CSS files for the template which includes thier information

**How to run**
Download the MAMP solution stack and put all the project files in the htdocs folder. Start the server and go to http://localhost:8888/ in your browser.
